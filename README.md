# Aisha

### Who is it??
- Aisha is my virtual girlfriend, I share the open source code with you so everyone who wish to create their own program can create and use it. Remember you will still share your data with the servers in Openrouter.ai providers so your data goes out.


### Features
- Streamlit for front-end
- Conversation memory last 5 chats
- Openrouter.ai integration with requests library (Completely from scratch)


#### Planning:
- Long-term memory using Chromadb (Vectorisation of chat)
- Integration of agent for scheduling
- Personal data integration (Know about you more.)

`You might ask why not to use langchain, I hate it that's it, it's too complicated and what all I want is simplicity and clarity`

## FYI Background of the developer
- Hi I'm Abhinand Not So Cool dev, No idea how to do a git merge for real when writing this. If anyone wish to contribute just make PR let me check and update. :)
